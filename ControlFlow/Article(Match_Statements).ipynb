    "Like the if-else statements, we can also use switch statements to build a program’s control flow. In Python, we have match-case statements that implement switch statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s discuss switch and match statements, how to define them in a Python program, and when to use match-case statements instead of if-else statements to build control flow in a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a Switch Statement?\n",
    "A switch statement is a control flow statement that executes a block of code, among many others, based on the value of a variable or expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functionally, switch-case statements are almost like if-else statements. For example, let’s look at the code from the if statements exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "user_name = \"Dave\"  \n",
    "if user_name == \"Dave\":   \n",
    "    print(\"Get off my computer Dave!\")   \n",
    "elif user_name == \"angela_catlady_87\":   \n",
    "    print(\"I know it is you, Dave! Go away!\")   \n",
    "elif user_name == \"Codecademy\":   \n",
    "    print(\"Access Granted.\")   \n",
    "else:   \n",
    "    print(\"Username not recognized.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The above code can be written using a switch statement, as shown in the following code. Don’t worry about the syntax. It’s explained in the next section.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "user_name = \"Dave\"  \n",
    "switch user_name:  \n",
    "    case \"Dave\":  \n",
    "        print(\"Get off my computer Dave!\")  \n",
    "    case \"angela_catlady_87\":  \n",
    "        print(\"I know it is you, Dave! Go away!\")   \n",
    "    case \"Codecademy\":  \n",
    "        print(\"Access Granted.\")  \n",
    "    case default:  \n",
    "        print(\"Username not recognized.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "If you run the above code, it will encounter a `SyntaxError` because Python does not have a switch keyword. Python didn’t have switch statements or any of its implementations until version 3.10.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python 3.10, we got match-case statements that implement switch statements and other functionalities. From now on, we will refer to switch-case statements as match-case statements, as defined in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to Declare a Match Statement in Python?\n",
    "we use the <span style=\"color: #00FFCC;\">match</span>, <span style=\"color: #00FFCC;\">case</span>, and <span style=\"color: #00FFCC;\">default</span> keywords to define match-case statements in Python. It has the following syntax:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "match expression:  \n",
    "    case value_1:  \n",
    "        # code to execute when expression equals value_1  \n",
    "    case value_2:  \n",
    "        # code to execute when expression equals value_2  \n",
    "    case value_3:  \n",
    "        # code to execute when expression equals value_3  \n",
    "    case value_4:  \n",
    "        # code to execute when expression equals value_4  \n",
    "    case value_N:  \n",
    "        # code to execute when expression equals value_N  \n",
    "    case default:  \n",
    "        # code to execute when expression isn't equal to any of the values\n",
    "```\n",
    "In the above code,\n",
    "- <span style=\"color: #00FFCC;\">match</span> is a keyword that marks the start of the match block.\n",
    "- <span style=\"color: #00FFCC;\">expression</span> can be a variable, an arithmetic expression, a Boolean expression, or a Python object like a list, tuple, or string.\n",
    "- The code inside a case block is executed for a single value of expression. For example, only if <span style=\"color: #00FFCC;\">expression</span>  evaluates to <span style=\"color: #00FFCC;\">value_1</span> will the code inside the <span style=\"color: #00FFCC;\">case value_1</span> block be executed. If <span style=\"color: #00FFCC;\">expression</span> evaluates to value_2, then only the code inside the case <span style=\"color: #00FFCC;\">value_2</span> block will be executed.\n",
    "- Only one case block is executed in the entire match block for any given value of <span style=\"color: #00FFCC;\">expression</span>. Once a case block is executed, the program’s control flow moves out of the match block.\n",
    "- The <span style=\"color: #00FFCC;\">edefault</span> block is always present at the end of the match block. If <span style=\"color: #00FFCC;\">expression</span> matches none of the values in other case blocks, the code inside <span style=\"color: #00FFCC;\">case default</span> is executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the above syntax, we can rewrite the code given in the switch-case example as shown below:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "user_name = \"Dave\"  \n",
    "match user_name:  \n",
    "    case \"Dave\":  \n",
    "        print(\"Get off my computer Dave!\")  \n",
    "    case \"angela_catlady_87\":  \n",
    "        print(\"I know it is you, Dave! Go away!\")   \n",
    "    case \"Codecademy\":  \n",
    "        print(\"Access Granted.\")  \n",
    "    case default:  \n",
    "        print(\"Username not recognized.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "If you run the above code, you will get the following output:\n",
    ">Get off my computer Dave!  \n",
    "\n",
    "## When to Use Match Statements in Python?\n",
    "- Match-case statements can be an efficient alternative to if-elif-else statements. When a variable or expression can take multiple values, and we need to perform a different action for each possible value, we can use match statements.\n",
    "- A match-case block can be used for other tasks, like structural pattern matching, in addition to replacing if-else blocks. This helps us check for different conditions on Python objects like lists, tuples, and strings.\n",
    "- Match-case statements are more readable compared to if-elif-else statements. Hence, in cases where we must check for many values that an expression or variable can take, we should use match-case statements."
