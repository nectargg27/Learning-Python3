    "<span style=\"color: yellow;\">Task 5</span>\n",

    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "random.randint(1, 9)\n",
    "```\n",
    "which will generate a random number between `1` (inclusive) and `9` (inclusive).\n",

    "<span style=\"color: yellow;\">Task 6</span>\n",
    "Now that we’ve declared all the variables needed, it’s time to implement the core logic of our program!\n",
    "\n",
    "For this section, we’ll be utilizing control flow using an `if`/`elif`/`else` statement to assign different answers for each randomly generated value.\n",

    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color: yellow;\">Task 7</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, write an `elif` statement after the `if` statement where if the `random_number` is equal to `2`, `answer` is assigned to the phrase “It is decidedly so”.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, continue writing `elif` statements for each of the remaining phrases for the values `3` to `9`.\n",

    "\n",
    "What if the asker does not provide a `name`, such that the value of `name` is an empty string? If the name string is empty, the output of the program looks like the following: \n",
    ">  asks: Will I win the lottery?\n",

    "\n",
    "As you can see, the formatting of the output can use some improvement when there is no name provided.\n",
